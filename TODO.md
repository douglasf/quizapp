## 🔵 FEATURES

- [ ] **F3: Investigate: Host-less quiz mode via shareable links** — New feature: Enable users to send a quiz link to a friend who can take the quiz without requiring a host to be present. Requires investigation into: (1) Is this architecturally feasible given the current host-driven quiz flow? (2) What changes would be needed to support player-only quiz mode? (3) How would the quiz timer and scoring work without a host? (4) What's the implementation scope (database schema, API endpoints, UI changes)? (5) How would quiz creation/access control work for shared links?

- [ ] **F4: Implement quiz creator notifications for host-less quiz completions** — After a player completes a host-less quiz, the quiz creator should be notified. Explore and decide on the notification method: email notifications (most straightforward), in-app notifications (if user is logged in), push notifications (if mobile app is developed), or a combination of methods. Also consider: notification content (player name, score, time), frequency/batching if multiple completions, opt-out options, and delivery reliability.

## 🟢 COMPLETED

### Bug Fixes
- [x] **TODO-BUG-001: PWA on iOS shows GitHub-style 404 page** — On iOS, opening the PWA displayed a GitHub 404 page instead of the app. Fixed by using relative paths and adding a 404 fallback for GitHub Pages SPA routing _(Fixed in commit f9a3f99)_

### Authentication & Cloud
- [x] Login and signup with JWT authentication
- [x] "My Quizzes" dashboard — view, manage, and launch saved quizzes
- [x] Cloud save — quizzes persisted to Cloudflare D1 database
- [x] Quiz sharing via unique share codes
- [x] **Stay logged in on device** — hosts now persist sessions across page refreshes and browser restarts without re-entering credentials. Fixed cross-site `SameSite` cookie policy (`Strict` → `None; Secure`) so refresh tokens are actually sent in the cross-origin production deployment, added proactive token refresh (on tab focus and before expiry) to eliminate 401-induced delays, and ensured the logout action fully clears the session with a visible logged-out state

### Images & Media
- [x] Cloudflare R2 integration for image storage
- [x] Image compression for uploaded question/answer images
- [x] **Reduce image compression aggressiveness** — improved quality for maps, flags, and photos _(Fixed in commit 971938f: adjusted compression parameters to balance clarity and transfer size)_
- [x] Question images (base64 upload, compression, host-only display)
- [x] Image-based answer options (visual identification questions — flags, landmarks, etc.)

### Defer Image Upload to Quiz Creation Time
- [x] **Upload images to Cloudflare on quiz save/create, not immediately on selection**
  - **Problem**: Previously, images were uploaded to Cloudflare the moment the user selected them in the quiz editor. If the user abandoned the quiz or swapped images, orphaned uploads accumulated in Cloudflare storage with no cleanup
  - **Why it matters**: Wastes Cloudflare storage and API calls on images that may never be used. Also makes the editor feel slower since each image selection triggers a network request
  - **Scope**: Medium — required buffering selected images locally (as base64 or blobs) during editing, then batch-uploading on save. Updated the create/save flow and handled upload failures gracefully

### Architecture & Infrastructure
- [x] PeerManager singleton (peer lifecycle independent of React lifecycle)
- [x] QR code bug fix (StrictMode double-mount race condition eliminated)
- [x] Host screen layout fixes (grid overflow, timer bar symmetry)
- [x] **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`** — prevent secrets from being committed _(Fixed in commit 47cf0e7: added `.env` to gitignore to prevent secret leaks)_

### Quiz Format & Documentation
- [x] **Create Schema JSON File for the Quiz Format** — authored a JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) at `public/quiz-schema.json` covering all 4 question types with conditional validation, field descriptions, and inline examples. Updated example quiz files with `$schema` references for editor autocomplete. Added Quiz Schema documentation section to README

### Question Types (All 6 Types Implemented)
- [x] Multiple Choice (4 options, speed-based scoring)
- [x] True/False (2 hardcoded options, speed-based scoring)
- [x] Slider (configurable range, proximity + speed scoring)
- [x] Multi-Choice (2-8 options, multiple correct answers, advanced scoring)

### Quiz Management
- [x] **Edit existing quizzes** — full edit support with PUT endpoint _(Fixed in commit 73130df: load quiz into editor, preserve ID/metadata, save updates via PUT)_

### Game Mechanics
- [x] Question timer (configurable per-question, 5-120 seconds)
- [x] Speed-based scoring system
- [x] Multi-choice scoring formula (base + penalty - wrong answers + speed bonus + perfect bonus)
- [x] Answer validation and reveal system
- [x] Player scoring and leaderboard

### Streamline "Host This Quiz" Screen UX
- [x] **Simplify and declutter the "host this quiz" screen layout**
  - **Problem**: The screen shown after creating a quiz is cluttered and unfocused. The raw quiz JSON is displayed prominently, the "Host This Quiz" button is buried among other controls, and the screen includes elements (like import-related options) that aren't relevant when the user just finished creating a quiz
  - **Why it matters**: After creating a quiz, the user's primary intent is to host it immediately — the current layout adds friction by forcing them to scan past irrelevant information. A cleaner post-creation flow improves the transition from "build" to "play" and makes the app feel more polished
  - **Specific improvements**:
    - [x] Collapse the quiz JSON into an accordion (closed by default) — useful for debugging but shouldn't dominate the screen
    - [x] Make the "Host This Quiz" button large and prominent at the top of the screen — this is the primary action
    - [x] Move controls that only make sense for importing (e.g., loading a different quiz) to the import screen instead
    - [x] Remove or de-emphasize any other low-priority UI elements to reduce visual noise
  - **Scope**: Small to medium — primarily layout and component reorganization. May involve splitting shared state between the host-quiz and import-quiz screens
  - **Completed in**: Commit `d165198`

### Enhancements
- [x] **F1: Make timer countdown much more noticeable with visual and audio effects** — Added urgent countdown effects with vignette overlay, heartbeat animation, and audio beeps on both host and player screens _(Completed in commit acbb9a4)_
- [x] **F2: Improve answer clarity on player screen after timer ends for multi-choice questions** — Added distinct status labels (Correct/Missed/Wrong), circular badge indicators, staggered slide-in and pulse animations, and improved border/shadow/opacity treatments across correct-selected, correct-missed, wrong-selected, and neutral states _(Completed in commit 1105de3)_

### UI/UX & Polish
- [x] Landscape layout for TV projection (2-column grid)
- [x] Answer summary with multi-column display
- [x] Scoreboard scaling for widescreen
- [x] Dynamic text scaling for long questions/answers
- [x] Example quiz with all 5 question types
- [x] PWA support with manifest.json and iOS standalone mode
- [x] **Player avatar icons** — replaced text avatar names with actual emoji characters _(Fixed in commit d83765b: avatars now render correctly on player/host screens)_

### Code Cleanup
- [x] Remove 8 dead component files
- [x] Remove 27 debug console.logs
- [x] CSS cross-browser fixes (justify-content: right → flex-end)

## 📋 PENDING (Low Priority)

### TODO-PEND-001: Replace `:has()` selectors with explicit CSS classes
- [ ] **Replace `:has()` selectors with explicit CSS classes** — 13 instances
  - **Status**: Pending (optional — browser support is good for `:has()`)
  - **Reason**: Better readability, explicit is better than implicit
  - **Scope**: Low complexity, cosmetic improvement

## 🚫 WON'T IMPLEMENT (Intentionally Deprioritized)

> These features were considered but intentionally deprioritized. The current
> question types and setup sufficiently cover the app's use cases.

- ~~**Swedish Translation Support**~~ — Demoted: daughter prefers English UI
- ~~**Free-text answers with fuzzy matching**~~ — Demoted: current question types cover all needs
- ~~**Flexible option counts for multiple choice**~~ — Demoted: multi-choice (2-8 options) already provides sufficient flexibility

## 📝 ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### Current Stack
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite (build tool and dev server)
- PeerJS for P2P connections (WebRTC)
- React Router with HashRouter (for GitHub Pages compatibility)
- Cloudflare Workers (API backend)
- Cloudflare D1 (SQLite database for quiz storage)
- Cloudflare R2 (object storage for images)
- JWT authentication (login/signup)
- Native CSS (no frameworks)
- StrictMode enabled (React dev checks)

### Key Patterns
- **PeerManager singleton**: Module-level peer instance, survived by React unmounts
- **useSyncExternalStore**: React bridge to external peer state
- **Module-level singletons**: Game code caching (no React state)
- **useCallback with stable refs**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders in game logic
- **HashRouter**: Ensures client-side routing works on GitHub Pages (no server-side rewrites)
- **JWT auth flow**: Access token stored in memory; refresh token in httpOnly cookie

### Known Limitations
- Question options limited to flexible count (multi-choice supports 2-8)
- No built-in error boundaries (would benefit from adding one)
- Player peer not yet a singleton (could eliminate `get_state` protocol)
- Image uploads deferred to quiz save (orphaned uploads eliminated — see COMPLETED section)
